# Meta purpose
That's my personal playground to get intouch with golang by a hobby project. Aiming at finding a well structured way with clean-code for a golang project.
The evaluation of modern build systems etc.pp. will be also part of this project.

# Obvious purpose
This small server shall provide a REST interface to an internal PostgreSQL database that stores all measurement data of my heating and electric utilities.
